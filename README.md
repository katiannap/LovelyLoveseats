# LovelyLoveseats

I decided to pursue the dream of small-business ownership and open up a furniture store called Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites on Fleet Street. With my knowledge of Python programming, I built a system to help speed up the process of creating receipts for my customers.

In this project, I stored the names and prices of a furniture store catalog in variables. I processed the total price and item list of customers, printed them to the output terminal.

I utilized strings and numbers to save a catalog of furniture, then performed concatenation and math calculations to create a receipt.
